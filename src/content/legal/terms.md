NeedList.ORG is a US 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation that, with its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, employees, and representatives (collectively “NLO”), operates the NeedList.ORG application, platform, website and associated sites (“App”). 

Throughout this Agreement, “we,” “our,” and “us” means NLO unless otherwise indicated.

These Terms of Use (“Terms of Use” or “Agreement”) are a contract between you and NLO, and govern your access and use of the NeedList.ORG App and all other sites owned and operated by NLO that have this Agreement posted, including, but not limited to, all transactions conducted on the App and all NLO services provided in connection with the App (together with the App, the “Service”). 

By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read and agree to all of the terms and conditions in, and linked to, this Agreement (including the Privacy Policy). 

By using the Service in any manner, including, but not limited to, visiting or browsing the App or contributing content, information, or other materials or services to the App, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. 

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP OR SERVICE.

SUMMARY OF SERVICE:

NeedList.ORG is a platform enabling donors (“Users”) to contribute towards the listed and approved goods and services (“NeedLists”) of vetted charitable initiatives (“Charities”) sourced from sponsor businesses and suppliers (“Sponsors”) invited to the Service by NLO.

Through the Service, electronic communications, and other media, the Service may make accessible various content, including videos, images, artwork, audio, text, comments, data, scripts, other materials and information, and associated trademarks and copyrightable works (collectively, "Content"). 

Users of the Service may have the ability to contribute, add, create, upload, submit, distribute, share, facilitate the distribution of, collect, post, or otherwise make accessible ("Post") Content ("User Submissions").

ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS:

The Service is offered subject to acceptance of all the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, including the Privacy Policy available at https://needlist.org/privacy, and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that may be published on the App by NLO, which are incorporated by reference. 

These Terms of Use apply to every User of the Service. 

In addition, some services offered through the Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions adopted by NLO (“Supplemental Terms”) which will either be listed in the Terms of Use or presented to you for your acceptance when you sign up to use the supplemental service(s). 

Your use of those services is subject to those Supplemental Terms, which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by this reference. 

If the Terms of Use are inconsistent with the Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms shall control with respect to such supplemental service(s).

The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old (or at least 13 years old and have the permission of a parent or legal guardian).

You represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are at least 18 years old (or at least 13 years old and have the permission of a parent or legal guardian) and of legal age in your jurisdiction to form a binding contract, and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. 

If you are creating a NeedList on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to enter into the Terms of Use on behalf of the organization you have named as the User, and to bind that company to the Terms of Use. 

NLO may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time.

NEEDLIST DONATIONS:

NeedList.ORG is a platform where Users can fund NeedLists of goods and services from Sponsors created by vetted Charities. 

By funding a NeedList with the Service, you agree to be bound by this entire Agreement, including the following terms:

• You agree to provide your payment information at the time you donate towards a NeedList. The payment will be collected by NLO at the time of your donation. The amount you donate is the amount you will be charged.

• You agree to provide NLO with valid payment information (a credit or debit card from Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us) or payment account credentials with a payment processor such as PayPal ("Payment Provider").

• Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated payment method or payment account credentials, and you must refer to that agreement and not these Terms of Use to determine your rights and liabilities.

• By providing NLO with your payment information or payment account credentials and associated payment information, you agree that NLO is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all donations that you make to NLO or a NeedList and that no additional notice or consent is required.

• You agree to immediately notify NLO of any change in your billing address or the payment information or payment account credentials used for payment hereunder. NLO reserves the right at any time to change its billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the App or by e-mail delivery to you.

• NLO reserves the right to cancel a donation at any time and for any reason.

• NLO reserves the right to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend a NeedList at any time and for any reason. NLO is not liable for any damages as a result of those actions. NLO may or may not comment on the reasons for any of those actions. In the event that a NeedList is rejected, canceled, interrupted, removed, or suspended, all Users that have funded the affected NeedList will be so notified, after which the User will be able to elect to have their donation refunded or redirected for a period of seven (7) days. If the User fails to elect their donation be refunded, donated funds will be reallocated to other NeedLists.

One hundred percent (100%) of the amounts donated to a NeedList by a User, minus any applicable payment processing fees and taxes, will be restricted and allotted to only purchase and deliver the line item or items approved to be funded in the NeedList. 

Users also have the option of donating an additional amount directly to NLO; one hundred percent (100%) of these amounts are used to fund the charitable operations of NLO.

By making a donation to a NeedList, you understand that NLO provides a platform to facilitate such donations, but that NLO is not a party to any agreement between any users. NLO is not a broker, agent, financial institution, creditor, or insurer for any user, and we do not intend to provide financial, legal, tax, or other professional advice. Before making any decision regarding any donations, you should consult your financial, legal, tax, or other professional advisor as appropriate. You acknowledge that you access any App Content by using the App at your own risk.

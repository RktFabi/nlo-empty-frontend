INTRODUCTION:

NeedList.ORG (“NLO”) is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. 

This Privacy Policy explains what information NLO collects from you when you access NLO’s site, platform, or application programming interface (“API,” and collectively with NLO’s application and platform, the “App”).  

NLO will not use or share your personal information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into and is a part of our Terms of Use.

If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about our Privacy Policy or data collection and processing practices, or if you want to report any security violations to us, please contact us at privacy@needlist.org.

USER CONSENT:

By submitting Personal Data through our App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

DONORS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES:

If you are a non-U.S. user of the App, by visiting the App and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. 

In addition, your personal information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be different from the laws in your country. 

By providing your data, you consent to such transfer.

CHILDREN: 

NLO does not intentionally or knowingly gather, collect, or solicit personal information from individuals who are under the age of 13. 

If an individual under the age of 13 submits personal information through the App and NLO learns that the personal information is the information of a child under the age of 13, NLO will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. 

If you believe that NLO might have any personal information from a child under the age of 13, please contact us immediately at privacy@needlist.org. 

INFORMATION WE COLLECT:

NLO may collect and process the following information about you:

• Information (such as your name, email, address, telephone number, and country of residence) that you provide by completing forms on the App.

• When you fund a NeedList on the App, NLO will collect information necessary to complete the donation in compliance with local laws and government requirements, including, but not limited to, your name, email address, address, internet protocol address, payment information, and billing information. 

NLO uses the payment information you enter to process transactions in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. 

Credit card payments are processed by a third-party provider (such as Stripe, PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, and other payment processors) and are governed by the third-party provider’s privacy policy and terms of service. 

Credit card information is never stored on NLO’s servers. 

• If you provide feedback or contact NLO via email, NLO will collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send a reply.

• Information that you provide voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, internet browser details, and other requested information if you contact NLO for support.

Information that we collect via technology as set forth in the section titled “Technology” below.

NLO will use the personal information you provide to:

• Enable NLO to contact you regarding any feedback you provide or inquiries you make through the App or email.

• Analyze details around the use of the App and the people visiting to improve the App.

• Protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, automated, unethical, or illegal activity.

• Other purposes that NLO may disclose to you when NLO requests your information.

SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION:

NLO does not rent, sell, or share your information for the purposes of profitable monetization.

NLO does not share your personal information with third parties other than as follows:

• To operate the App and provide services to you or to fulfill any other purposes for which you provide the information;

• To respond to your requests or questions or notify you about changes to the App or Service;

• With third party vendors and providers (such as payment processors), consultants, and other service providers who work for NLO and require access to the information in order to work and function, for example, with our fulfillment and service vendors, referral tracking services, payment processors, and site analytics tools such as Google Analytics;

• As part of ongoing efforts to enhance your experience and improve services and protect against fraudulent, automated, and unauthorized activity, NLO is ethically incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) throughout various parts of the App;

• To (i) comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process, (ii) to protect NLO’s and its agents, users, and partners’ rights and property, including to enforce NLO’s agreements, policies, and Terms of Use; or (iii) in an emergency to protect the personal safety of NLO, its users, or any person.

• In connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction, or proceeding involving the sale, transfer, divestiture or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another organization.

• With your consent or as NLO may describe to you when you provide the information; and 

• As permissible under applicable laws and regulations.

We may also share aggregated or de-identified meta-information.

YOUR INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES: 

We strive to only email when it is absolutely necessary and appropriate to do so.

We give you the ability to opt out by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the emails you receive or by contacting NLO directly at privacy@needlist.org. 

Despite your indicated email preferences, NLO may send you service-related communications, including emails related to your donations and any updates to NLO’s Terms of Use or Privacy Policy. 

You may also send requests about your contact preferences and changes to your information, including requests to opt-out of sharing your personal information with third parties, by emailing NLO at privacy@needlist.org.

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES:

NLO uses third-party services such as Stripe, PayPal, Google, and a variety of other service providers for payments, analytics, and other technology and business services necessary for our App to function. 

When you make a purchase, the payment processor such as Stripe receives information about you, your transaction, and your payment instrument. 

Additionally, these payment processors collect standard information about your device that may be sufficient to uniquely recognize it. 

This information is used to operate and improve the services provided to us and to you, including for fraud detection, prevention, and compliance purposes. 

TECHNOLOGY:

NLO uses various technologies to enhance your experience on our App. 

• “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a site or app saves to your device when you access it. NLO may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them) to provide you with a secure and functional interactive experience on our App. This type of information is collected to make the App function properly and make it more useful to you and to tailor the experience with NLO to meet your special interests and needs. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this will affect and possibly disable certain features, functionality, or services of the App. 

• Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s device, Pixel Tags are embedded in web pages. Pixel Tags also allow NLO to send email messages in a format users can read, and they tell NLO whether emails have been viewed. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.

• NLO uses Google Analytics and other legitimate technology analysis tools to help us understand how users use our Apps and Sites. These analytics tools use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the App, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the App. NLO uses the information obtained from these analytics tools only to improve the App and NLO’s services. Analytics tools may collect only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the App, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. Although analytics tools may use persistent Cookies on your web browser to identify you as a unique user when you visit the App, the Cookie can only be used by that analytics tool. The ability to use and share information collected by analytics tools is restricted by their terms of use and privacy policy.

VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:

Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas of the App, such as in the creation of a NeedList, becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. You should exercise caution before disclosing personal information through these public venues.

SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION:

We are committed to protecting the security of your private, personal, and payment information. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. 

When you create an account with NLO, you are the only person allowed to use that account. Please do not allow anyone else to access your account. 

When you make a donation on the App, information about your donation is transmitted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and payment information is tokenized so that it is never stored on NLO’s servers. NLO stores data in cloud-based environments that use firewalls and other industry-standard protections in an effort to prevent access from unauthorized intruders. Access to data is limited to the individuals and APIs that need it in order to perform their business function and is protected wherever possible by two-factor authentication.

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while NLO uses reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, NLO cannot guarantee its absolute security.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY:

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. NLO will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy at https://needlist.org/privacy and changing the “Last Updated” date above. You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
